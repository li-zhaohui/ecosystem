Twirl Finance is on the verge of launching a streamlined lending platform that will give the DeFi scene on Solana a whole new level of liquidity.

The main goal at Twirl Finance is to give idle Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens a distinct use case by making it possible for them to be used as leverage for borrowing.

â€‹By lending LP tokens rather than other assets, users can begin to accrue trade fees from the AMM while lowering the average interest rate paid.
