LunaYield's platform focuses on two primary objects:

1. To deliver an easy and smooth Yield Farming experience, auto-compounding yield at empirical optimal intervals, whilst saving gas cost and time, hence, bring a notable increase in terms of profit compared to other yield-farming platforms on Solana Chain.

2. To provide a safe and sustainable vault for Yield Farmers. Our Vaults got audited by several reputable auditing firms within the industry, and always got the highest score possible. Furthermore, our vaults only featured the most secured pools and pairs, to benefit farmers in the long run.
