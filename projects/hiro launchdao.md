Hiro brings innovation to Solana in a way that holds true to blockchain ethos. It provides not only equitable and open access to venture funding new projects in the Solana ecosystem but also equitable and open access to the stewardship of those funds and decision-making over which projects to incubate. By creating a meritocratic network with an innovative consensus and incentive mechanism, Hiro ensures the longevity of its portfolio projects and moves investor focus into the long term.

Hiro utilizes Solana for its high transaction throughput, which gives power to the functionality of the voting systems and allows for fair access based on merit rather than ability to cover fees.
